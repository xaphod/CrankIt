# Crank It - iOS

Crank It for iOS controls the volume of Denon (and some Marantz) receivers, using the Network.framework on port 23.

This software is provided under the GNU GPL 3.0 license -- see LICENSE.

## Installation

Just want the app on your phone? It's live on the App Store - [get it here](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/crank-it-for-denon-marantz/id1511655050)

Otherwise, to compile it locally so you can make your own changes: fork the repo, clone it, and run `pod install` to install pods.

## Firebase Crashlytics
This project uses Google Firebase to provide crash reporting (Crashlytics). The project expects the file `GoogleService-Info.plist` in the `DenonVolume/` folder, which is a Firebase-generated file that identifies the project. 

You can either remove Firebase by editing `AppDelegate.swift` and removing the lines `import Firebase` and `FirebaseApp.configure()`, or, create your own Firebase project and provide `GoogleService-Info.plist`.

## Running
Open the `xcworkspace` generated by `pod install` in XCode and compile & run.

## Requirements
Tested on iOS 12 and above.
